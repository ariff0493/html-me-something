         <p>50 First Dates is one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies, but it's an added bonus that Drew Berrymore is also in it. I really like the way
            this movie can be super funny and goofy but at the same time it is very sweet and serious. Penguins are my favorite non domestic animal
            as well! It is definltey one of my comfort movies that I have watched countless times and can probably quote to you.

              This is my all time favorite Disney movie. I have always thought the stories I have heard about the Gods were interesting and this movie
              definitely instilled that in me. The soundtrack to this is also some of the best music that I have ever heard. I am excited to show my 
              future children this movie and hopefully watch it on repeat as much as I did when I was little. My fianc&#233;e PROBABLY wouldn't mind.

            <h2>3. How the Grinch Stole Christmas</h2>
               <p><img src="images/grinch.jpg" alt="The Grinch" width="400" height="600" /></p>
               <p>I could watch this movie all year round. Unfortunately most people don't like that since it's a Christmas movie. I remember when I first got 
                  this on VHS on Christmas Eve one year. I put it in my TV/VHS combo that night as soon as I got home. Caused a fire hazard by placing
                  my blanket directly over the heat vent and fell asleep. While it's not everyone's favorite Grinch movie it is certainly mine.

               <h2>2. Dirty Dancing</h2>
               <p><img src="images/dirtydancing.jpg" alt="dancing" width="400" height="600" /></p>
               <p>This was a movie that I watched with my grandma more times than I can count. When I saw this for the first time
                  I was sitting in her recliner with her in our living room. We would occassionally order pizza and have oreos and milk when she turned
                  this on. After me and my mom moved out meand my grandma still watched that almost everytime I went to visit her house.</p>

                  <acticle><h2>1. HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY</h2>
                  <p><img src="images/hgttg.jpg" alt="httg" width="400" height="600" /></p>
                  <p class="funParagraph">This movie is probably the most watched throughout my entire life. I love the parallels in Arthur Dent's story about
                     his home being destroyed and earth being destroyed. I love this film so much that I decided to get a tattoo of the message on 
                     the first page of the book the movie is based on. Don't Panic. I have some pretty awful anxiety at times &#38; I got this tattoo
                     as a reminder to myself to stay calm. It's also got quite a catch song that starts the movie.
